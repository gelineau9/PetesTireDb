# Petes Tire Database Management System
This database management program was designed as a project for a local business. The program utilizes Java code to interface with MySQL to execute a library of PreparedStatement queries to manage and control the system. The program is a response to hand-written tire inventory that was time consuming and expensive, with the hope to streamline the process and make the inventory's management less tiresome. Future work will be primarily focused on a GUI, as well as streamlining/improving login and user management features, to make it more viable in its user-focused purpose.

The initial data was gathered from the last hand-written inventory recorded in an excel sheet. The user must login to begin using the program. To do so they are given a temp user with no permissions to allow the user to log in. After logging in, the user will then be prompted to enter their desired function from a list of functions, and subsequently they will be prompted to fill out the input for the respective function (query). The query is then executed using Java's PreparedStatement library and the user may run the program again at need. The excel sheets are loaded into MySQL to initialize the DB with the load function which fills the table based on the excel sheet's data. The contents of the DB can also be written to excel with the save feature.
